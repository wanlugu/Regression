observed dependent variable: (values of the variable being predicted)
#ordinary least squares (OLS)
a type of linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. 
OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by the principle of least squares: 
min sum [(y in the given dataset- predicted \hat{y} by the linear function)^2]
Assumptions: Classical linear regression model + Independent and identically distributed (iid)
